## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections

**This is where you talk about your project!**

>This starter code is just some simple faces being drawn. 

Today I worked on the basic forms of the visual aspects of my code. I am focusing on designing my face and applying any elements and feautures of the face which in the future I want to randomize. I am begining to apply parameters to the shapes on the face and planning how I can use the variables to create interesting randoms. 

Today I moved over to the arrangment code to begin experiemneting with ideas. Initially i was planning on having a hectic array of colours and shapes in the background and randomly placing my faces amongst them to continue the theme of chaos and random shapes. However the idea of having a painting gallery seemed more appropriate and easier to look at. Using tilt value I have alligned a picture frame to go behind the faces, I have also reduced the number of faces on the screen to only three. 

I have added a new visual feature to my face. An array of eyes which I plan to randomly arrange around the face. I have also parameterised more features of the face which I have randomized to create a unique face every time. I paramterised the lower nose and added nostrils which now randomly shift along the x axis, changing the shape and thickness of the nose. I also parameterised the rotation of the eyes so they have a random rotation. Finally I have randomised the colours of each feature on the face. Generating a random red, green and blue value, the faces now generate a random rainbow of colours. 

FINAL README: 

Randomised Cubism Face
by Jamie Matthews

DESCRIPTION:
For this project, I was tasked to create a face which can be randomly changed creating a wide variety of unique outputs. Starting with a base code, I worked on creating a unique visual style with my face and then parameterising particular elements which can be randomized. 

PROCESS:
From the beginning I knew I wanted to create a face with a similar style to picasso that was inspired by the cubism movement. I liked this style because I knew it would fit the project nicely in using random features. Since the Cubism movement is very unpredictable and random, I could use this to my advantage and make my shapes do almost anything and it will suit the style. I started with a simple face profile and from there I layered random shapes ontop of each other to form a face. Once I had created a visual style I was happy with I began to parameterise features of the face which I wanted to change.
